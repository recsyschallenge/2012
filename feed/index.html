<p>Call for Presentations – RecSysChallenge 2012<br />
Workshop of the Recommender Systems Challenge</p>
<p>in conjunction with ACM Recommender Systems 2012</p>
<p>Dublin, Ireland, 13 September 2012</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>*** Extended abstract (2-4 pages) submission deadline: 20 August 2012 ***<br />
*** Accepted presentations to be invited to post-proceedings volume on data-oriented RecSys Challenges ***<br />
The Recommender Systems Challenge of ACM RecSys 2012 (RecSysChallenge 2012) will take place as a full-day workshop on Thursday September 13th and will run as an interactive event during which participants will be guided through the whole process of participating in such a data-oriented contest.</p>
<p>Taking as examples the datasets that drove the contest of this year’s challenge (with data from the Moviepilot and Mendeley platforms), we want to present, discuss and reflect on all the important steps of developing, testing and deploying recommendation algorithms over a real-life dataset. It will start from the way a dataset may be acquired and processed, explore how an evaluation that will produce results comparable and reproducable by others may be performed, and close with a discussion on how novel recommendation approaches can reach final deployment in commercial applications.</p>
<p>Confirmed speakers include contributors to recommender systems&#8217; frameworks such as Lenskit, Mahout and MyMediaLite; recommender system technology companies such as Gravity R&amp;D; as well as chief technology officers from real-life platforms like the Moviepilot and Mendeley ones.</p>
<p>We invite interested researchers and developers to share their experience of working with a dataset in the context of the RecSysChallenge and report on their succesful or unsuccesful efforts. Contributions can be related to any stage of the participation to the challenge. We are particularly interested to hearing from groups that have gained access to this year&#8217;s datasets from Moviepilots and Mendeley but have faced difficulties in developing a complete and competitive contribution to the RecSysChallenge.<br />

Final Call for Papers &#8211; RecSysChallenge 2012<br />
The Recommender Systems Challenge</p>
<p>in conjunction with ACM Recommender Systems 2012</p>
<p>Dublin, Ireland, 13 September 2012</p>
<p>http://www.recsyschallenge.com</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>*** Submission deadline: 22 June 2012 ***</p>
<p>As in other research areas, the availability of data sets in recommender systems can be considered as key for research and application purposes.<br />
These data sets serve as benchmarks to develop new algorithms and to compare them to other algorithms in given settings.<br />
Furthermore, they can be used for experimenting with new recommendation methods, services, as well as added-value services related to recommendation (such as supporting visualisation and argumentation).</p>
<p>The Recommender System Challenge, in conjunction with ACM RecSys 2012, invites participants to work on two tracks with real-world datasets.</p>
<p>Benchmarking Track: Context-Aware Movie Recommendation (CAMRa&#8217;12)<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
The track addresses context-aware recommendation and context-aware evaluation and live evaluation of recommendations.<br />
For this, a dataset from moviepilot is made available, this dataset contains information related to concepts from the world of cinema,<br />
e.g. single movies, movie universes (such as the world of Harry Potter movies), upcoming details (trailers, teasers, news, etc).<br />
At the end of the challenge, a live evaluation session will take place where algorithms trained on offline data will be evaluated online, on real users.<br />
The aim is to find the right audience for a given movie. This movie does not necessarily exist already (as it might be in production),<br />
the goal is to generate a large impact on the recommended item in terms of interaction in the social networks of those users to whom the movies are recommended.<br />
To access the data, send an email with your name and affiliation to camra@recsyschallenge.com.<br />
The track is following the previous Challenges on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation that took place in 2010 and 2011.</p>

<p>Exploratory Track: Scientific Paper Recommendation (ScienceRec&#8217;12)<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
This track focuses on recommendations to users about scientific papers that they might be interested in, using a data set that comes from the Mendeley system (www.mendeley.com).<br />
The aim is to share recommendation approaches and discuss issues like the types of scientific recommendation services that social research platforms like Mendeley could implement<br />
or the types of data sets that could help advance research around scientific paper recommendation.<br />
Submissions are expected to use the already published Mendeley dataset which came out after the 1st DataTEL Challenge of RecSysTEL 2010: http://dev.mendeley.com/datachallenge/<br />
The ScienceRec Track asks participants to use and evaluate their approaches in an off-line manner, but is also interested in proposals for relevant services,<br />
navigational interfaces, visualisations of recommendations etc. Thus it welcomes submissions that will combine the data set with the Mendeley API: http://dev.mendeley.com/<br />
It has to be noted that in the Mendeley dataset, the document IDs do not match up to the document IDs in the API.<br />
For privacy reasons, Mendeley cannot currently reveal the document IDs in the dataset, as this will make quite obvious who&#8217;s libraries it is making public (creating privacy and data protection issues).<br />
Submissions will need to take into consideration this limitation, exploring (and showcasing) possible combinations of the data sources,<br />
demonstrating them using example, sample or simulated data, as well as outlining such kind of limitations and possible solutions  such as dataset licensing from the users themselves.</p>
